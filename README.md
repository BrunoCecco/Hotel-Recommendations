# Hotel Recomendations Overview

Machine Learning project created to recommend hotels to customers for companies like Expedia.

Planning a vaction with thousands of options is hard! This project aims to use customer data to predict the likelihood a user will stay at 100 different hotel groups.

The data in this competition is a random selection from Expedia and is not representative of the overall statistics.

## Model Performance

The Jaccard similarity index compares members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct. It’s a measure of similarity for the two sets of data, with a range from 0% to 100%. The higher the percentage, the more similar the two populations. Although it’s easy to interpret, it is extremely sensitive to small samples sizes and may give erroneous results, especially with very small samples or data sets with missing observations.
